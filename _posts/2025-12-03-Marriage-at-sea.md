Beginning

The story of the book initially revolved around Maurice and Marylain, but it was later edited to feature Maryain and Maurice. While I was reading, I noticed a change in the narrative.

Their first voyage to the sea was undertaken in a simple boat. They faced severe physical and mental hardships due to drifting on a small dinghy and a life raft attached to it.

One day, a hole appeared on the deck because a whale nearly attacked it. As a result, the captaincy changed from Maurice to Maryain, his wife.

From that moment on, Mr. Maurice’s life took a different turn. He longed for his wife’s strength and consideration.
