> I met one of my old friend. He was on his way home. Small bag on his shoulder carried he.
> He said he woke up 2 or 3 am in the morning every day like his deceased father. He either walked or biked since awake.     
> It lasted about 5 hours for us to talk. It was all about things happened receltly to each one.
> Those brief and pleasant chat reminded us of memory 30 years ago.  
> What a nice afternoon for two of us!
