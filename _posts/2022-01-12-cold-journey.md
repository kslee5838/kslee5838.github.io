- It was cold as if I put on a flannel shirt    
- Cautious steps needed on sheer icy path    
- It seemed much far above my eyes to see guiding rope     
- Shoulders were shaken with heavy wind   
- I'd like dive into deep valley which unfolded its arms wide
- Having lunch on the pick was somewhat beyond reality
