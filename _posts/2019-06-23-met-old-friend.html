I met old friend. He was on his way home. Small bag on his shoulder carried he.
He said he woke up 2 or 3 am in the morning every day like his the late father. He either walked or biked since awaken.
It lasted about 5 hours for us to talk. It was all about things happened receltly to each one.
Those brief and pleasant chat reminded us of memory 30 years ago.
What a nice afternoon for two of us!
